### Welcome to my open source machine learning projects!
Stick around if you want to take a deep dive into the technical side of machine learning. I follow a first principles approach to all my projects. This means some of the projects can require a significant amount of time to completely understand, but don't let that demotivate you. The knowledge you will gain is invaluable. I provide supplimentary material in all my Readme's, so take a look at those if you get stuck. Most of my projects require a basic level of understanding in machine learning. If you are new to machine learning you will likely be out of your depth, but don't worry I have the perfect material to get you started:

I don't focus on the deployment and maintenance side in my open source projects because this is dependant on your deployment enviroment, which is highly variable. This makes my project relevent to a much larger audience. I provide all the tools necessary to understand how to create the machine learning models, but you need to be familiar with your deployment environment to productionise the models. Check the material below if you want to learn about deploying and maintaining models in production:

## My Background
**Professional Career:** I work full time as a Machine Learning Engineer. I work professionally on the end-to-end model development lifecycle from prototyping to deploying and maintaining models in production. 

**Studies:** My studies in university were in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and physics. This gave me a strong foundation in the theory side of machine learning. I've learnt to leave no stone unturned, because anything you don't fully understand might come back to bite you once the complexity ramps up. You will see this approach reflected in all my projects. 

**Interests:** My interests are in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Explainable AI and Recommenders. This is by no means an exhaustive list, my interest are constantly expanding as the machine learning landscape evolves.
